## Usage

On the home screen the user can click on the 'Start Quiz' button and that will begin the timer allowing the user 75 seconds to answer 5 questions. The timer can be seen on the top right of the page for the duration of the quiz. If the user gets the answer correct then they will see 'Correct!' displayed while moving on to the next question. If the user gets the answer wrong, they lose 10 seconds of time, 'Wrong!' will be displayed and it will move on to the next question. Once the user reaches the last question or the time runs out, the quiz will end and the user can log their time as a score. This score will then be stored and can be compared to all other scores from the user until they choose to clear the log of high scores from the local storage using the 'Clear high scores' button. Clicking on the 'Go back' button on the high score log will reload the quiz from the start. Finally, users can access their high score at any time by clicking on the 'View high scores' link at the top left side of the page.
